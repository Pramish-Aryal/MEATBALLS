# Metaballs
A rough visualization of [Metaballs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaballs) using [marching squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares). Still needs a lot of work tho.

### Build Instructions
This project was built using [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). Setup raylib like so:
additional includes inside ./code/extern/
lib files inside ./lib/
run build.ps1

or get it working yourself ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Will prolly automate everything later on. But for now it is what it is.
